Introduction
The TribalTrove is the one-stop-online platform that solely caters to people with an aim to give them one-of-a-kind shopping experience through partnership with talented artists and craftsmen across Nepal with whom customers around the Nepal are connected. 
Platform is intended to address the dilemma of fading traditional values such as craftsmanship and cultural richness, which are increasingly being replaced by fast fashion and global connectivity. TribalTrove's purpose is to create an environment in which artists can take pride, stories are shared, and everyone is unique. The platform continues the history of local craft fairs by allowing merchants to create their own internet stores at a reasonable cost per item. TribalTrove distinguishes itself from other commerce platforms by emphasizing on the expertise, legacy, and stories behind the crafts, rather than just the products.
